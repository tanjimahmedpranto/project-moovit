# project-moovit
project-moovit created by GitHub Classroom. The source code for Muuvit, an application developed as part of the Project Course, a 15ECTS course involving students from Abo Akademi University. The course involves planning and developing the appropriate product or service.

I was the project's front-end developer and designer.

Muuvit is a social platform (on the web) where members can create and participate in small scale outdoor sport/exercise events (eg. skiing, yoga in the park, functional training at the outdoor gym). When one hosts events the event gets an own page where one can add information about the event. The events are open so everybody can participate. The events may have an upper limit of participants

Start the server by going into the system directory and typing `npm run dev` and start the client by going into the frontend and typing `npm start`. Everything should work after that.
